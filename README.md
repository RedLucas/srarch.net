# srarch.net

A replacement website for the late SÃ¸ren Rasmussen's now-defunct SRA business' website: srarch.net

Next.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.

When running `next build`, Next.js generates an HTML file per route. By breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files, Next.js can avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript code on the client-side, reducing the bundle size and enabling faster page loads.
